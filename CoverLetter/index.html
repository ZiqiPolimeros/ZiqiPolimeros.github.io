        Dear Hiring Manager,
        <p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the AWS Data Engineer position at HealthFirst. The company’s mission and values resonate strongly with me, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to your progress and success.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated a passion for learning and a commitment to excellence. Graduating with an associate degree in mathematics from the prestigious Borough of Manhattan Community College, I achieved outstanding academic performance, earning straight A’s in all my math, physics, and computer science classes. Eager to expand my knowledge and skills further, I subsequently pursued a bachelor’s degree in Statistics at Baruch College. During this time, I also completed the challenging EverUp Micro-Credential in Finance and a comprehensive data analyst bootcamp program at the NYC Data Science Academy.</p>
        <p>My work ethic is driven by a dedication to accuracy and consistency in all tasks, both individually and as part of a team. In the NYC Data Science Academy projects, I collected and analyzed data from reputable sources, such as government and company websites, utilizing my proficiency in Python and R for data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis. The reports I produced adhered to professional guidelines, providing clear and concise insights into the purpose, methodology, and conclusions of the analysis. My emphasis on layout design and the use of statistical diagrams enhanced the readability and attractiveness of these reports.</p>
        <p>In addition, I have gained valuable tutoring experience. I work as a tutor in middle school math classes, where I honed my ability to explain complex problems in a detailed and step-by-step manner. Interacting with students and providing guidance allows me to contribute to their academic growth and development.</p>
        <p>Overall, my academic achievements, hands-on experience in data analysis, and ability to effectively communicate complex ideas make me a compelling candidate for the AWS Data Engineer position. I have attached my resume for your review, which provides additional details about my education and employment history. I would be delighted to discuss further how my abilities can add value to your organization during an interview.</p>
